    With over a decade of leadership experience both in and out of tech, my focus has long been building and enabling high-performing teams that deliver work of the highest quality. I've spent time in retail, tech support, customer success, development engineering, product, partnerships, and engineering and product leadership, always focused on the customer, the team, and driving things forward. Below is my resume, which is focused on my time at Cisco. For a full overview of my pre-tech experience, please take a look at my LinkedIn.
